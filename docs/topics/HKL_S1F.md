**HKL_S1F** - *Human kappa and lambda chain, silent, 1-mer, functional substitution model.*

Description
--------------------

1-mer substitution model of somatic hypermutation based on analysis of silent mutations
in functional kappa and lambda light chain Ig sequences from Homo sapiens.


Usage
--------------------
```
HKL_S1F
```




Format
-------------------

A 4x4 matrix of nucleotide substitution rates. The rates are normalized,
therefore each row sums up to 1.


Note
-------------------

Reported in Table III in Cui et al, 2016.
