**MK_RS1NF** - *Mouse kappa chain, replacement and silent, 1-mer, non-functional substitution model.*

Description
--------------------

1-mer substitution model of somatic hypermutation based on analysis of replacement and
silent mutations in non-functional kappa light chain Ig sequences from NP-immunized Mus
musculus.


Usage
--------------------
```
MK_RS1NF
```




Format
-------------------
A 4x4 matrix of nucleotide substitution rates. The rates are normalized,
therefore each row sums up to 1.

Note
-------------------

`MK_RS1NF` replaces `M1NDistance` from versions of SHazaM prior to 0.1.5.
