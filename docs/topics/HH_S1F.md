**HH_S1F** - *Human heavy chain, silent, 1-mer, functional substitution model.*

Description
--------------------

1-mer substitution model of somatic hypermutation based on analysis of silent mutations
in functional heavy chain Ig sequences from Homo sapiens.


Usage
--------------------
```
HH_S1F
```


Format
-------------------
A 4x4 symmetric matrix of nucleotide substitution rates. The rates are normalized,
therefore each row and each column sum up to 1.
