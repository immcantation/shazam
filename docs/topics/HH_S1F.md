**HH_S1F** - *Human heavy chain, silent, 1-mer, functional substitution model.*

Description
--------------------

1-mer substitution model of somatic hypermutation based on analysis of silent mutations
in functional heavy chain Ig sequences from Homo sapiens.


Usage
--------------------
```
HH_S1F
```




Format
-------------------
A 4x4 matrix of nucleotide substitution rates. The rates are normalized,
therefore each row sums up to 1.

Note
-------------------

`HH_S1F` replaces `HS1FDistance` in versions of SHazaM prior to 0.1.5.
